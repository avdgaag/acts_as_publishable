= acts_as_publishable 1.1

This plugin lets you add basic time-based publishing-behaviour to your models by specifying a publication range with to date attributes.

== Usage

To use simply call the plugin in your model:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_publishable
  end

This includes two special finder methods for finding published and unpublished models, and adds some basic instance methods for working with individual objects--most notably the 'published?'-flag.

== Testing

You can check if the plugin installed correctly by testing it yourself (in the plugin dir.):

  rake test
